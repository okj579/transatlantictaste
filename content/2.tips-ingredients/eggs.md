Eggs are a staple food in many parts of the world and are consumed in various ways, from scrambled and boiled to poached and fried. While eggs may seem like a simple and straightforward food item, there can be significant differences in how they are produced and labeled in different parts of the world. Let's look at some of the differences between the United States and Germany.

The first thing you might notice about eggs in a German supermarket is that they're left out unrefrigerated. Don't worry, it's perfectly safe. In Europe, chickens are vaccinated against samonella and the other most common pathogens. This means the eggs don't have to be washed at the farm, which would actually weaken their natural defenses, shorten shelf life and make refrigeration necessary. It's still recommended to refrigerate at home to extend their freshness, but it's not a safety issue.

### Egg Sizes

Egg sizes are also a bit different. As a rule of thumb, the EU sizes are one size larger than the US sizes. For example, the US size "Large" is roughly equivalent to the EU size "M". These are also the most common sizes and usually meant when a recipe doesn't specify. If you do need to make conversions, these are the minimum weights for each size:

| Size              | US        |           | EU    |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Small (S)         | 1.25 oz   | 35.4 g    | -     |
| Medium (M)        | 1.75 oz   | 49.6 g    | 53 g  |
| Large (L)         | 2 oz      | 56.8 g    | 63 g  |
| Extra-Large (XL)  | 2.25 oz   | 63.8 g    | 73 g  |
| Jumbo             | 2.5 oz    | 70.9 g    | -     |
