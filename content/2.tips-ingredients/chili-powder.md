In an American kitchen, chili powder is one of the basic spices you need for all kinds of dishes. It can be hard to find in Germany, though. The container labeled "Chilis" in the spice isle is in fact pure ground chili peppers, which is very different and much spicier. I like to mix up a batch of my own every once in a while to use in all my recipes.
