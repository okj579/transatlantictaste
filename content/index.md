**Welcome to Transatlantic Taste, your guide to cooking across borders with easy conversions and tips.**

I'm Owen, a US native who has called Germany home for over a decade. During this time, I've wrestled with adapting US recipes to a German kitchen and learned a lot about it. Over time, I curated a collection of converted recipes, accompanied by plenty of insights on ingredient usage and sourcing. And why not invite you along for this culinary journey? I'm excited to share what I've learned, my love for cooking, and some great recipes. Whether you're in the mood for classic American comfort or ready for a culinary adventure, Transatlantic Taste is your friendly guide to savoring the harmonious flavors of two continents. 

**Let's cook up something delicious together!**
