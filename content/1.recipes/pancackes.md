You can actually find pancake mix in Germany if you look hard enough, but I prefer making them from scratch. This is the recipe I memorized as a child and still make to this day.

#ingredients

|  amount |  mass | name                     |
|--------:|------:|--------------------------|
|  1 cups | 140 g | all-purpose flour        |
|  1 Tbsp |  14 g | sugar                    |
|   2 tsp |   8 g | baking powder            |
| 1/4 tsp |       | salt                     |
|       1 |       | eggs                     |
|  1 cups |       | milk                     |
|  2 Tbsp |       | oil                      |
|         |       | fresh berries (optional) |

#description
If you want to make fruit compote to top it with, start that first and it can cook down while you make the pancakes.

#steps
1. Mix the dry ingredients together in a mixing bowl.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, milk and oil together.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix together. Try not to mix too long or the pancakes will become rubbery - it's OK if the batter is a bit lumpy. If your adding berries or other fruit, mix them in here.
4. Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan and heat it.
5. Pour batter into the pan - about 1/3 cup for a medium-sized pancake (I can fit 3 into my 14-in pan).
6. Flip when the edges of the pancakes are firm and the bubbles on top are starting to keep their shape when they pop. Cook until both sides are golden brown.
7. Top with maple syrup, butter, cinnamon sugar or fruit compote.

#steps
1. Add fruit, sugar and a splash of water to a small pot.
2. Simmer on medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sauce thickens and the fruit is falling apart.
