title: Dilly Beans (Fridge Pickles)

I've had real trouble finding some good dill pickles here in Germany. Eventually I decided I needed to make my own. I
didn't necessarily want to go through the time and trouble of canning, though. Fridge pickles are a quick alternative to
true canning. They're ready to eat in about 2 days and keep 4-6 weeks.
