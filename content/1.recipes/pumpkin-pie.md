#steps
1. **For the pumpkin purée:** Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds. Place the halves on a lined baking sheet and roast in the oven at 175°C (350°F) for about 45 minutes until the flesh is soft. When the pumpkin is cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh and mash with a fork. This will keep in the fridge for a few days, if you'd like to prepare it in advance.
2. **For the filling:** Beat the eggs and mix in the sugar, spices, puréed pumpkin and cream.
3. Form the pie crust into a greased 11in (28cm) pie tin. With puff pastry sheets, you'll probably have to cut and reassemble it into the right shape. First cover as much of one side as you can, then cut off the excess and use it to cover the rest of the pan. Overlap the dough slightly and push them together to seal the crust.
4. Pour in the filling and bake on the bottom rack at 220°C (425°F) for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 175°C (350°F) and bake for another 45-55 minutes.
5. Let the pie cool for about 2 hours, then serve with whipped cream.
