I was born and raised in the US and I've been living in Germany for over 10 years now. Over that time I've struggled with cooking using ingredients and measurements from multiple countries. I ended up compiling a list of recipes for myself that I'd converted to be used in my German kitchen and lots of information about how to do it, how to usw which ingredients and where to find them. I decided to share my knowledge with anyone interested in cooking recipes from a different country.",{"title":51},{"type":60,"children":61,"toc":88},"root",[62,69,76],{"type":63,"tag":64,"props":65,"children":66},"element","p",{},[67],{"type":68,"value":57},"text",{"type":63,"tag":70,"props":71,"children":73},"h2",{"id":72},"contact",[74],{"type":68,"value":75},"Contact",{"type":63,"tag":64,"props":77,"children":78},{},[79,81],{"type":68,"value":80},"You can get in touch with me at ",{"type":63,"tag":82,"props":83,"children":85},"a",{"href":84},"mailto:sayhi@transatlantictaste.com",[86],{"type":68,"value":87},"sayhi@transatlantictaste.com",{"title":54,"searchDepth":89,"depth":89,"links":90},2,[91],{"id":72,"depth":89,"text":75},"markdown","content:9.about.md","content","9.about.md","md",[98],{"_path":99,"title":100,"navigation":55},"/legal","Legal",1705259436760]
