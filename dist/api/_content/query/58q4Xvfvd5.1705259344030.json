Don't worry, it's perfectly safe. In Europe, chickens are vaccinated against samonella and the other most common pathogens.

It's still recommended to refrigerate at home to extend their freshness, but it's not a safety issue."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"egg-sizes"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Egg Sizes"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Egg sizes are also a bit different.
