If you aren't in the habit, I'd recommend trying your hand at it. In the modern world, it's not so fiddly as some people imagine. With a digital kitchen scale, you can simply set your mixing bowl on it, zero the scale and pour in your ingredient until it shows the right weight. Thats much easier than measuring out 2 2/3 cups of something and less dishes to do afterwards. You also dont have to worry about what exactly \"packed,\" \"heaped,\" or \"scant\" mean to this author. 400g of flour is always 400g of flour. The one thing I do usually use volume for is spices.
